# Improve school workload and wellbeing

This application is built using Nanoc, a powerful static site generator that
offers flexibility and a rich set of features for building static websites. Our
choice of Nanoc is driven by its robust "Checking" feature, ensuring
high-quality content and avoiding regressions.
