# Step by step guide showing how to submit and manage flexible working requests

<strong class="govuk-tag">Example</strong>

This guide outlines the process for submitting and managing flexible working requests in a school, trust or other setting.

This includes:

- timelines for acknowledgment
- meetings
- decision-making
- possible trial periods
- written confirmations
- options for appeal following partial or full rejection of requests

You may wish to amend as appropriate and include this as part of your school, trust or other setting’s flexible working policy.

This process must be completed within 2 months of a request being made. It is good practice to reach a decision as quickly as possible, although the time limit may be extended if agreed by employer and employee.
