# Make a statutory flexible working request

<strong class="govuk-tag">Template</strong>

## Introduction

If you do not already have a flexible working request template, you can share this resource with staff in your school or setting so they can use it to write their own statutory flexible working request. It may be beneficial to provide them with the ‘Review a statutory flexible working request’ resource to offer additional support as they prepare their request.

Staff members can also consult with their trade union when drafting the request.

## How was this developed?

This was developed through the Department for Education’s flexible working ambassador schools project, with support from other sector experts.

This template is intended for use by school staff across all educational settings, including:

- maintained schools
- academies/trusts
- special schools
- alternative provision settings
- pupil referral units

It can also be adapted for, or may be helpful to, other education settings, such as sixth-form colleges, further education colleges and other providers.

## Main content

The template is split into 4 sections:

- Section 1 – Eligibility
- Section 2 – Details of the requestor
- Section 3 – Flexible working request
- Section 4 – Signatory
