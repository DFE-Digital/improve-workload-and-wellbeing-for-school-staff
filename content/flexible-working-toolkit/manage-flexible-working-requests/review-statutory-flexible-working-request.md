# Review a statutory flexible working request

<strong class="govuk-tag">Template</strong>

## Introduction

Use this template to help ensure you follow a fair and consistent approach when staff make a flexible working request. This will help reach the best possible outcome, that considers the needs of the individual making the request, their team and the school.

You should always support a flexible working request, unless there is a genuine operational reason not to.

## How was this developed?

This resource was developed through the Department for Education (DfE)’s flexible working ambassador schools project, with support from other sector experts.

This template is intended for use by school staff across all educational settings, including:

- maintained schools
- academies/trusts
- special schools
- alternative provision settings
- pupil referral units

It can also be adapted for, or may be helpful to, other education settings, such as early years, sixth-form colleges, further education colleges and other providers.

## Flexible working request review template

This template is designed to help decision makers review statutory flexible working requests. It is possible to request flexible working outside the statutory route and employers can still consider these requests.

Having a clear flexible working policy and strategy can ensure a consistent approach and promotes a proactive whole-school approach to flexible working within your school.

Using the template will ensure that a fair and consistent approach is followed. Taking into account the needs of the individual making the request, their team and the school will ensure the best possible outcome is reached.

Following a consistent process for each request will help you to ensure that all requests are dealt with in a reasonable manner. The template sets out the issues to be considered before deciding if the school/ setting/ trust can support the request.
