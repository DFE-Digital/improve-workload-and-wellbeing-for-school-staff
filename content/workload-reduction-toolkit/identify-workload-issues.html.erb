            How to use this section
          </h2>
          <p>
            You can choose the resources you want to use and adapt them for your
            school context. They will help you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>identify the causes of the biggest workload issues</li>
            <li>understand how your staff feel about workload</li>
            <li>
              prioritise
              <a href="<%= @base_url %>/workload-reduction-toolkit/address-workload-issues" class="govuk-link">specific workload areas</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a senior leadership team, decide whether you will address
            workload across the whole school, by department or in individual
            teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regularly reviewing workload with all your staff will help you to
            understand workload issues and evaluate the impact you are having.
          </p>
