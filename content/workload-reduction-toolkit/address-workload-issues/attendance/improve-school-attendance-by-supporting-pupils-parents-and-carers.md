    <ul>
      <li>
        reduced staff workload - clear roles and processes mean less stress for school leaders, teachers and support staff when pupils are absent from school
      </li>
      <li>
        higher attendance rates - attendance has risen from 94% before COVID to nearly 96%
      </li>
      <li>
        better relationships with families - positive communication is key to build trust between schools and parents

## Background from Ben Levinson, Executive Headteacher

Our process for managing absences is straightforward for parents, carers and staff to use. However we’ve found that it’s also important to address the reasons why pupils miss school in the first place. When attendance is poor, it increases the workload for school leaders and staff – for example, we need to follow up and understand why a pupil is absent, and complete administrative tasks to record absences. Therefore, it’s essential to tackle the root causes of non-attendance to reduce the workload it creates later.

At Kensington Primary School, we’ve improved attendance rates and reduced staff workload by building a strong school community, removing barriers to entry and putting in place clear processes when absences happen. School leaders can choose to use or adapt these techniques in their own school setting.

Taking proactive steps early can help reduce the time, effort and resources schools need to invest to manage attendance. At the core of this approach are the everyday practices already happening in schools - such as extracurricular clubs and engaging with pupils and their families. We’ve found that when these things are done well, they create a positive school culture that encourages better attendance. They also reduce the upstream workload for school staff.

## Build a culture of inclusion and support

Creating a sense of belonging is central to improving attendance at our school. We:

- prioritise helping new pupils settle in quickly, especially those who join mid-year
- invest time in building strong relationships with families, maintaining a supportive and collaborative environment

We want Kensington Primary School to be a community pupils, parents and carers love to be in.

We also help families who struggle getting their children to school in the morning through pupil clubs, such as a breakfast club and sports clubs. Activities promoting physical and emotional wellbeing also positively impact pupil health, improving attendance overall.

## Put in place clear processes

At Kensington Primary School, when a child is reported as absent:

1. Parents and carers call our office team or log it through our automated attendance system (we use Studybugs, however other software is available).
2. The report is passed on to the pupil’s phase assistant headteacher (phase AHT).
3. The phase AHT decides on next steps - a phone call home, or a home visit by a senior leader or office team member.
4. The phase AHT uses data to see if there are any concerns about a pupil or group of pupils, to identify ways to support them and improve their attendance.

By implementing this streamlined process with defined roles, everyone is clear who handles follow-ups for absent pupils and who does not need to deal with it. This:

- keeps tasks like phone calls and home visits organised, and reduces the workload created by miscommunication with parents – for example, parents who are frustrated that they have received an unfair or inaccurate letter home
- reduces disruption to teaching - all teachers are made aware which pupils are absent before classes begin
- lowers staff stress

## Encourage attendance positively

We do not use awards or certificates to positively reinforce attendance, as they can make some pupils feel left out - for example, children who have special needs or who, through no fault of their own, are not able to have 100% attendance.

Instead, we focus on building strong relationships. Our school leaders:

- greet families at the gate each morning, building trust and connection with the community
- co-ordinate via a dedicated digital channel to proactively check in with pupils who are showing distress
- call parents and carers to reassure them that their child is OK, if they let us know they are worried about them

## Remove barriers to attendance

We try to identify and reduce potential barriers to attendance before they escalate. This:

- saves our senior leaders and school staff time and effort in the long run
- ensures families get the help they need as early as possible

For example, our pupils wear sports kits to school every day. Our uniform rules are not restrictive, so there’s no cost barrier for families to send their child to school. We also have free sports kits available to families who experience financial difficulties.
