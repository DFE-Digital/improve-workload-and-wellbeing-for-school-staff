## Background from David Lowbridge-Ellis, MBE, Director of School Improvement

Preparing reports for governing boards is often a time-consuming task for school leaders. Finding a balance between including all the key information and keeping the report manageable can be difficult. At the Matrix Academy Trust, we’ve created a reporting template to simplify this process - ensuring key information is presented clearly, while reducing preparation workload for school leaders.

## Why we use a governing board reporting template

This template helps keep governing board reports concise and clear. It’s shared with board members before meetings, so scheduled time can be used more effectively.

Although the template was designed for a multi-academy trust, it can be adapted for other school types. It should also be adapted by senior leaders based on the context of the school, different governing board priorities or areas of focus and contain any local requirements.

## Key benefits

### 1. Simplified reporting process

We organise our governing board report into 3 main sections:

- items for discussion, which board members read ahead of the board meeting
- items requiring board approval
- items for information only, unless board members would like to discuss them

Links to further information, such as attendance reports, are embedded in the document to keep the format clear. Board members can read this extra information before or after the meeting if they want to.

### 2. Improved strategic focus

The template structure helps board members prioritise discussions on the most impactful topics.

In each meeting, we primarily focus on:

- attendance
- year 11 and year 13 outcomes
- School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)
- key areas of development and examples of great practice, via a heat map table
- support plans

Keeping the agenda the same each time ensures that every meeting runs efficiently.

### 3. Reduction in preparation time

School leaders can input new information into the template as soon as it becomes available.

At the Matrix Academy Trust, this report is a live document that we update continuously. This means that by the time a board meeting happens, there’s no need for any additional preparation.

## Additional support from the National Governance Association (NGA)

NGA has also shared templates to support headteachers and academy trust leaders with reporting to governors/trustees.

The governing board determines the scope, content and frequency of the reports they receive from school/trust leaders. This should be kept under review to ensure that the information requested is useful and effective. The format and content of the report should help the governing board to stay focused on its strategic functions – a report that includes too much operational detail may lead to the board becoming distracted or overwhelmed.

Headteachers can use the following template to support efficient reporting and robust monitoring. The template is suitable for all types of single school including maintained and single academy trusts.

Multi academy trusts can use the template below to ensure that information they share with trustees is robust and relevant. Trusts should adapt the reports and reporting timetable to their context, taking into account their size, scheme of delegation and the particular remits of their executive leaders.
