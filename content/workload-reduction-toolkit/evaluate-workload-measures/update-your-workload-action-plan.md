## Background from Neil Cully, Headteacher

Notre Dame High School created a [wellbeing committee](/staff-wellbeing/communicate-about-wellbeing/establish-a-wellbeing-committee) that issued a
workload survey to its staff. They used the results to create an action plan which focuses on improving staff wellbeing
and reducing workload.

The action plan outlines the key areas of focus, the actions that need to be taken, what success looks like and the
timescale for actions to be taken.

## Update your action plan

When you update your action plan, Notre Dame High School advise the following:

### Check you included all your actions

Make sure you include all the actions you took to meet your objectives.

### See if you met your success criteria

Determine if those actions have been achieved.

### Evaluate and decide any further outcomes

When you have completed the actions on your plan, evaluate how they went. For example, re-run the workload survey you
used to identify the initial issues, or have structured conversations to see how the actions impacted staff workload.
This evaluation and any further actions should be discussed and agreed with all staff.

## Consider these questions when updating your action plan

Notre Dame High School considered the following questions for their action plan:

- who did we do this for?
- did it improve the quality of teaching?
- what impact did it have on students?
- can we do this in a more efficient and effective way?
