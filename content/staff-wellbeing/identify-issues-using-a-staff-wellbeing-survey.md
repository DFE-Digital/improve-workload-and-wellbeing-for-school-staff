## Suggestions for running a successful survey

School leaders who have conducted staff surveys in their own schools shared the following suggestions for running a successful survey:

## Decide when and how often to run the survey

Consider when in the school year it would be best to run your staff survey for it to have the most impact and allow you to act on the results.

Carrying out regular surveys will allow you to evaluate the impact that your actions are having on staff wellbeing, for example, some schools run these annually.

## Decide who to survey and how long it will run for

You could choose to survey a group of staff, for example middle leaders or teaching assistants and edit the survey to reflect their role.

You should explain to staff how long the survey will remain open for.

## Decide whether you need to anonymise the survey

An anonymous survey may encourage more accurate responses from the staff who take part. If you want to understand differences in wellbeing between teams or groups, questions about name and role can be added.

You should edit the survey to tell your staff if the survey is anonymous or not.

## Decide what to do next

You will need to consider the sequence of how you will act on the results of your staff survey. Give yourself time to analyse the results, update your staff and take action.

You can address wellbeing issues you identify using resources from across this website, however the list is not exhaustive. You can help other school leaders by [sharing what has worked in your school](https://improve-workload-and-wellbeing-for-school-staff.education.gov.uk/share-your-ideas/).
