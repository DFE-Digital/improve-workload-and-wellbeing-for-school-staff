## Background

{inset-text}

Headteacher Marijke Miles was concerned by the ‘quiet disappearance’ of older teachers from the profession and considered menopause a contributing factor to this. Looking at her school’s workforce data on age and gender, she could predict a surge in the need for menopause support in the coming years. Marijke took a proactive approach to their menopause support. Some of the steps Baycroft School has implemented are set out below. These have had a tangible impact, supporting teachers and support staff to access support more quickly and to stay in work.

## Build a culture of individualised support

We gather feedback from staff through structured six-weekly line management meetings. This allows for nuanced, personal conversations.

## Menopause champions lead on advocacy, support and training

We established a new role - menopause champion.

We developed a clear role description and invited staff to apply. One teacher and one member of support staff took on the roles, providing a balance of experience.

The champions manage the menopause programme, preparing and promoting resources and monitoring best practice in other schools. Resources are regularly shared through Teams channels and in a lending library in the staff room.

They can advocate for others and provide practical, empathetic support. They provide a termly update on their work and ensure new staff are aware of the offer.

The two staff members initially appointed as champions were trained through an external provider. They have since provided training for the entire staff body, including all line managers.

## Implement practical and visible support measures

At Baycroft, we now provide resources and adjustments for those who need them, including:

- Hand fans
- Period products in all toilets
- A menopause library and Teams channel for ongoing support
- Investment in air conditioning and fans to allow for climate control
- Wellbeing activities, including a walking group and yoga sessions tailored for menopause

## Embed an open culture and challenge stigma

We take an explicit, proactive approach to menopause support and have a clear and visible offer. This removes stigma, recognising that feeling alone and voiceless can be one of the most difficult aspects of menopause.

We are clear that we are open to discussing reasonable adjustments, enabling our valued staff to perform well and feel comfortable in their working environment.
