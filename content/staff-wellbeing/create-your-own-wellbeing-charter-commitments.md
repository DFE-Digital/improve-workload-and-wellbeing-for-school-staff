## Background from Matt Piggott, Vice Principal and Amy Panayi, Associate Principal

{inset-text}

At Leigh Academy Strood, part of the Leigh Academies Trust, wellbeing is one of our 10 core values. We are committed to continually developing and enhancing our approach to staff wellbeing.

When the new school leadership team was established, the school had a high leaver rate and high sickness absences. The leadership team focused on staff wellbeing and made a public commitment by signing up to the [Education Staff Wellbeing Charter](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter). This led to the development of a school-specific set of wellbeing commitments.

## How we developed an agreed set of wellbeing commitments

The Education Staff Wellbeing Charter states that everyone has a role to play in creating and sustaining the conditions for every member of staff to thrive. We worked collaboratively with staff across the school to develop our own set of wellbeing commitments and promises to staff.

Staff provided feedback at senior leadership meetings, staff meetings and through our staff survey. We compiled a final list of existing initiatives, tailored to suit our staff, and new wellbeing measures suggested through the consultation exercise. Staff felt that, as in the Education Staff Wellbeing Charter, our charter should set out the commitments made at different levels. These included commitments from:

- the Trust
- the school leadership
- staff
- the Wellbeing team

The resulting commitments, agreed by all staff, are displayed throughout the school. They are a visible reminder of our shared commitment, not only to students but also to staff.
