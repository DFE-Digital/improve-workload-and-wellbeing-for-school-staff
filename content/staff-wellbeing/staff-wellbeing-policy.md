## Background from Mary Hall, Vice Principal

{inset-text}

At the Pingle Academy we have introduced practices to support staff wellbeing.

For example, we:

- train line managers at all levels
- reduced the volume of emails sent to staff
- avoid directed time after 4:30pm.

Staff have access to a number of resources to support their mental health.

Our policy aligns with our trust’s wellbeing strategy.

## The Pingle Academy’s staff wellbeing policy

This policy aims to:

- support the wellbeing of all staff to avoid negative impacts on their mental and physical health
- provide a supportive work environment for all staff
- acknowledge the needs of staff and how these change over time
- allow staff to balance their working lives with their personal needs and responsibilities
- help staff with any specific wellbeing issues they experience
- ensure that staff understand their role in working towards the above aims
- consider the needs of individuals
- create an environment where wellbeing is part of daily practice

## Role of all staff

All staff are expected to:

- treat each other with empathy and respect
- keep in mind the workload and wellbeing of other members of staff
- support other members of staff if they become stressed, such as by providing practical assistance or emotional reassurance
- speak honestly about their wellbeing and let other members of staff know when they need support
- contribute positively towards morale and team spirit
- use shared areas respectfully, such as the staff room

## Role of line managers

Line managers are expected to:

- monitor workloads, be alert to signs of stress and regularly talk to staff about their work-life balance
- maintain positive relationships with their staff and value them for their skills and contributions, not their working pattern
- familiarise themselves with trust and academy policies related to wellbeing
- discuss wellbeing as part of line management and faculty meetings
- make sure new staff are given a thorough induction programme and feel able to ask for help
- provide a non-judgemental and confidential support system to their staff
- understand that personal issues and pressures at work may have a temporary effect on work performance
- make sure any personal issues are taken into account during any appraisal or capability procedures
- promote information about, and access to, external support services
- help arrange personal and professional development training where appropriate
- keep in touch with staff if they are absent for long periods and conduct return to work interviews to support staff back into work
- conduct exit interviews with resigning staff to help identify whether any wellbeing issues lead to their resignation
- take any complaints or concerns seriously and deal with them appropriately using the academy’s policies

## Role of senior staff

The principal, vice principal and business office manager are responsible for wellbeing across the academy.

Senior staff are expected to:

- lead in setting standards for conduct, including how they treat other members of staff and being respectful of agreed working hours
- manage a non-judgemental and confidential support system for staff
- monitor the wellbeing of staff through regular surveys and structured conversations
- make sure accountability systems are based on trust and professional dialogue, with proportionate amounts of direct monitoring
- regularly review the demands on staff, such as the time spent on paperwork
- make sure job descriptions are kept up-to-date, with clearly identified responsibilities
- consult staff before any changes are made to job descriptions
- listen to the views of staff and involve them in decision-making processes, including consideration of any workload implications of new initiatives
- communicate new initiatives effectively to all members of staff to ensure they feel included and aware of any changes occurring at the academy
- make sure that the efforts and successes of staff are recognised and celebrated
- produce calendars of meetings, deadlines and events so that staff can plan ahead and manage their workload
- provide resources to promote staff wellbeing, such as training opportunities
- promote information about and access to external support services
- organise extra support during times of stress, such as Ofsted inspections
- welcome suggestions and give feedback

## Role of the principal

Creating a positive and supportive atmosphere throughout the school, the principal will:

- operate an open-door policy for all staff
- ensure that all polices that affect staff wellbeing are adhered to and reviewed
- monitor staff attendance data
- appraise the governing board of issues to do with staff wellbeing
- consult with representatives from unions regarding staff wellbeing

## Role of the local governing body

The local governing body is expected to:

- make sure the academy is fulfilling its duty of care as an employer, such as by giving staff a reasonable workload and creating a supportive work environment
- monitor and support the wellbeing of the principal
- make decisions and review policies with staff wellbeing in mind, particularly in regard to workload
- be reasonable about the format and quantity of information asked for from staff as part of monitoring work
- ensure that resources and support services are in place to promote staff wellbeing
- ensure that staff are clear about the purpose of any monitoring visits and what information will be required from them

## Managing specific wellbeing issues

The academy will support and discuss options with any member of staff who raises wellbeing issues. This can include situations where they are experiencing significant stress at the academy or in their personal lives.

Where possible, support will be given by line managers or senior staff.

At all times, the confidentiality and dignity of staff will be maintained.

Support could be given through:

- reassessing their workload and deciding what tasks to prioritise
- temporarily relieving them of some duties
- giving staff time off to deal with a personal crisis
- arranging external support, such as counselling or occupational health services
- the flexible working hours policy, which aims to cater for the needs of all staff
- the principal supporting requests from staff for reduced or part-time working, where personal circumstances mean that it would improve their work-life balance
- completing a risk assessment and following through with any actions identified
- phased return or altered hours after absence

## Academy wellbeing committee and plan

The academy will facilitate a wellbeing committee with members from across the staff. Their role will be to develop an action plan to promote a range of wellbeing interventions. It will:

- seek the views of staff on wellbeing regularly and promote and communicate wellbeing activities
- represent the academy as part of the Trust Change Champion Group
