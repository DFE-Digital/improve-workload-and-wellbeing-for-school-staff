## Background from Mary Hall, Vice Principal

{inset-text}

At the Pingle Academy we have introduced practices to support staff wellbeing.  

For example, we: 
* train line managers at all levels
* reduced the volume of emails sent to staff
* avoid directed time after 4:30pm.  

Staff have access to a number of resources to support their mental health. 

Our policy aligns with our trust’s wellbeing strategy.

* speak honestly about their wellbeing and let other members of staff know when they need support 

* contribute positively towards morale and team spirit 

* use shared areas respectfully, such as the staff room  

## Role of line managers 

Line managers are expected to: 

* monitor workloads, be alert to signs of stress and regularly talk to staff about their work-life balance 

* maintain positive relationships with their staff and value them for their skills and contributions, not their working pattern 

* familiarise themselves with trust and academy policies related to wellbeing 

* discuss wellbeing as part of line management and faculty meetings

* take any complaints or concerns seriously and deal with them appropriately using the academy’s policies 

## Role of senior staff 

The principal, vice principal and business office manager are responsible for wellbeing across the academy. 

Senior staff are expected to:

* communicate new initiatives effectively to all members of staff to ensure they feel included and aware of any changes occurring at the academy

* produce calendars of meetings, deadlines and events so that staff can plan ahead and manage their workload 

* provide resources to promote staff wellbeing, such as training opportunities 

* promote information about and access to external support services 

* organise extra support during times of stress, such as Ofsted inspections

## Role of the principal 

Creating a positive and supportive atmosphere throughout the school, the principal will: 

* operate an open-door policy for all staff 

* ensure that all polices that affect staff wellbeing are adhered to and reviewed 

* monitor staff attendance data 

* appraise the governing board of issues to do with staff wellbeing 

* consult with representatives from unions regarding staff wellbeing 

## Role of the local governing body  

The local governing body is expected to:

* monitor and support the wellbeing of the principal 

* make decisions and review policies with staff wellbeing in mind, particularly in regard to workload 

* be reasonable about the format and quantity of information asked for from staff as part of monitoring work 

* ensure that resources and support services are in place to promote staff wellbeing 

* ensure that staff are clear about the purpose of any monitoring visits and what information will be required from them 

## Managing specific wellbeing issues 

The academy will support and discuss options with any member of staff who raises wellbeing issues. This can include situations where they are experiencing significant stress at the academy or in their personal lives.  

Where possible, support will be given by line managers or senior staff.  

At all times, the confidentiality and dignity of staff will be maintained.  

Support could be given through: 

* reassessing their workload and deciding what tasks to prioritise 

* temporarily relieving them of some duties 

* giving staff time off to deal with a personal crisis 

* arranging external support, such as counselling or occupational health services 

* the flexible working hours policy, which aims to cater for the needs of all staff

* the principal supporting requests from staff for reduced or part-time working, where personal circumstances mean that it would improve their work-life balance 

* completing a risk assessment and following through with any actions identified 

* phased return or altered hours after absence 

## Academy wellbeing committee and plan 

The academy will facilitate a wellbeing committee with members from across the staff. Their role will be to develop an action plan to promote a range of wellbeing interventions. It will: 

* seek the views of staff on wellbeing regularly and promote and communicate wellbeing activities   

* represent the academy as part of the Trust Change Champion Group
